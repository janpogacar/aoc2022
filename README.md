# Advent of Code 2022
A repository containing code and data relating to the 2022 rendition of Advent of Code.

## About the code
Any code you find here was probably written in haste. It should not be considered optimized, neat,
or following any established programming practice. It shows *a way* of solving the given problem,
which at the time of writing, seemed the easiest to implement.

## Goals for this year
- Beat last year's achievement of 28 stars.
- Learn a bit more about graph theory and tree traversal
- Explore fuctionalities of Numpy
- Not let this project get in the way of my free time too much
